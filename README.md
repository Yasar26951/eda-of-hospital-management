🏥 Hospital Management EDA
📊 Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a hospital management dataset to uncover insights related to appointments, treatments, billing, patient demographics, and physician metrics. The goal is to identify trends, bottlenecks, and patterns that can inform better hospital decision-making and patient care.

📁 Dataset Structure
The dataset includes multiple tables merged into a single flat file with the following key columns:

appointment_id, appointment_date, appointment_time

patient_id, age, gender

doctor_id, specialization, years_experience

treatment_type, description, status

bill_id, amount, payment_method, payment_status

hospital_branch

🧪 Objectives
Understand patient demographics and appointment distributions

Analyze appointment volume and cancellation/scheduling patterns

Examine treatment types and doctor specializations

Explore billing amounts and payment trends

Highlight possible inefficiencies in scheduling or resource allocation

📌 Key Questions Explored
Which departments/specializations receive the most appointments?

What are the busiest time slots and days of the week?

Are certain treatment types more associated with cancellations or delays?

How does billing vary by hospital branch or treatment category?

Are there significant differences in patient age and treatment type correlations?

📈 Tools Used
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

datetime for time-based insights

📌 Inconsistencies in Doctor Specialization vs. Treatment
A doctor with a Dermatology/Pediatrics background is recommending chemotherapy at high frequency, which suggests a possible misclassification or role mismatch.

Oncology specialists, who are expected to handle chemotherapy cases, appear to recommend diagnostic tests like MRI and ECG more often, possibly indicating a difference in treatment approach.

👥 Patient Distribution & Patterns
Patient continuity is lacking: A 70-year-old cancer patient saw multiple doctors—only two of which were oncologists—showing no clear continuity in care, which might impact treatment outcomes.

30% of follow-up patients receive chemotherapy, suggesting either a high cancer burden or possible over-recommendation without standardized diagnostic procedures.

📊 Demographic Trends
Most patients are male, and fall within the age group of 20–35, yet chemotherapy is a dominant treatment—which is unusual unless there's a specific cancer type prevalent in younger males (e.g., testicular or Hodgkin's lymphoma).

💸 Treatment Cost vs. Experience Level
Less experienced doctors are linked to more expensive treatments, which might reflect over-reliance on aggressive or branded protocols, potentially due to lack of nuanced judgment.

However, most patients are consulting high-experience doctors, which may suggest a split in treatment styles or referral bias for complex cases.
